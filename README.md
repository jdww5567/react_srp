Visualizes the recursive process involved with the arithmetic-geometric mean, but for arbitrary values of the generalized mean. Uses react for updating the graph when inputs change or the window is resized and use plotly for the 3d graphing. Picked "custom" prompt; takes in user input in the form of text and number; utilizes useEffect and useState; the 3d graph updates depending on any of the inputs changing.

Uses Vite. Do npm run dev.
